Build a professional web app called "VeriTrust" using only pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).

The app must:
- Allow users to input text, image, audio, or video.
- Show a loading animation while processing.
- Display two independent result panels:

Panel 1: "Authenticity"
- Verdict: Likely Real / Likely AI / Mixed / Uncertain
- Confidence %
- Evidence bullets

Panel 2: "Truthfulness"
- Verdict: Likely True / Likely False / Mixed / Uncertain
- Confidence %
- Evidence bullets

Design:
- Minimal, professional, trustworthy aesthetic (white/gray/blue)
- Responsive layout
- Upload drag-and-drop area
- Clear typography
- Timeline-style evidence display

No backend, just mock API calls with placeholder JSON responses.

Structure:
- index.html
- style.css
- app.js

Make it look like a real startup demo.
